# AlloGen

"Allo-", from the Ancient Greek *állos* (ἄλλος), meaning "other", "different", or "alien".

"-gen", from the Ancient Greek suffix *genos* (γένος), meaning "kind", "family", or "birth".

or 

"gen-", from the Latin prefix *genus*, sharing similar meaning with the Ancient Greek.

`AlloGen` is then a collection of software tools oriented around the *genetics* and the *generation* of **The Alien** in the building of *perforated systems* and synaptic worlds.

## About

### The Alien

**The Alien** is not any one particular thing, though it might be, but rather an everpresent notion existing as an abstract field, permeating every *topos* in the world of AlloGen.  It is in a [landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape), under a set of [conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function), that The Alien will arise.  

And so will it too, though in different forms, arise from another landscape bounded under another set of conditions, and so forth...

### The Topoi of **AlloGen**

The [world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voyage_to_Arcturus) of AlloGen encompasses many distinct but interconnected kingdoms and landscapes implemented as a collection of Python modules, coding notebooks, Max project files, Max4Live devices, SuperCollider and *gen~* code, and general command line applications.  Each functions as both a didactic aid and a generalized toolset.

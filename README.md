# AlloGen

"Allo-", from the Ancient Greek *állos* (ἄλλος), meaning "other", "different", or "alien".

"-gen", from the Ancient Greek suffix *genos* (γένος), meaning "kind", "family", or "birth".

or 

"gen-", from the Latin prefix *genus*, sharing similar meaning with the Ancient Greek.

`AlloGen` is then a stand-alone software, and a companion library for [`AlloPy`](https://github.com/kr4g/AlloPy.git), oriented around the *genetics* and the *generation* of **The Alien**.

## The Alien

**The Alien** is not any one particular thing, though it might be, but rather an everpresent notion existing as an abstract field that permeates every [*topos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voyage_to_Arcturus) in the world of AlloGen.  It is in a landscape, under a set of conditions, that The Alien will arise.  

And so will it too, though in different forms, arise from another landscape bounded under another set of conditions, and so forth...

## The Topoi of **AlloGen**

The world of AlloGen encompasses many distinct but interconnected kingdoms and landscapes implemented as a collection of Python modules, coding notebooks, Max project files, Max4Live devices, SuperCollider and *gen~* code, and general command line applications.

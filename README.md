# AlloGen
Genetic and generative companion library for [AlloPy](https://github.com/kr4g/AlloPy.git)

"Allo-", from the Ancient Greek "ἄλλος" (állos), meaning "other" or "different."

"-gen", from the Ancient Greek "γένος" (genos), meaning "kind," "family," or "birth."

`AlloGen` is then a stand-alone software and a companion library for `AlloPy` oriented around the *genetics* and the *generation* of the *Alien*.

*Coming soon...*

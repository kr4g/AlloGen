# AlloGen

"Allo-", from the Ancient Greek "ἄλλος" (állos), meaning "other", "different", or "alien".

"-gen", from the Ancient Greek suffix "γένος" (genos), meaning "kind", "family", or "birth".

or 

"gen-", from the Latin prefix *genus*, sharing similar meaning with the Ancient Greek.

`AlloGen` is then a stand-alone software, and a companion library for [`AlloPy`](https://github.com/kr4g/AlloPy.git), oriented around the *genetics* and the *generation* of the *Alien*.
